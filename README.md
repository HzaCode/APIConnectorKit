**ServerSync** showcases practical examples of server interactions, focusing on data management, synchronization, and ensuring data integrity. It is structured for easy future reference and practical application.

#### **CompoundSaver**

[**`CompoundSaver.py`**](https://github.com/HzaCode/ServerSync/blob/main/CompoundSaver.py) demonstrates server interaction through the retrieval and storage of chemical compound information to a server. This process involves automatic data fetching and prompts for manual data entry when necessary, ensuring data completeness.

#### **CompoundUpdater**

[**`CompoundUpdater.py`**](https://github.com/HzaCode/ServerSync/blob/main/CompoundUpdater.py) offers a straightforward and efficient approach to batch update specific properties of chemical compounds on a server. By reading the list of compounds from the server and carrying out the update operations, this tool can flexibly handle potential issues with some drug codes, ensuring a smooth update process.
