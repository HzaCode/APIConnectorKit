### Examples


#### **CompoundSaver**

[**`CompoundSaver.py`**](https://github.com/HzaCode/ServerSync/blob/main/CompoundSaver.py) demonstrates server interaction through the retrieval and storage of chemical compound information to a server. This process involves automatic data fetching and prompts for manual data entry when necessary, ensuring data completeness, serving as the initial example of server communication.
